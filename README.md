## Tooltips.txt
Shortly after XWF introduced custom tooltips in version 19.4, I created an English Tooltips.txt by copy/pasting from the XWF manual.  This version was made available from XWF in 2018 and later included in XWF versions 20.5 through 20.7.  In the meantime I began working on a replacement and unbeknownst to me so did one of the XWF developers.  Starting with version 20.8, XWF replaced Tooltips.txt with their internally developed one.  When I finally finished my replacement Tooltips.txt, XWF declined to use it.  This repo contains a copy of my Tooltips.txt for anyone that is interested in using it.

Contains the following notable features.
- The results of checking a box are clearly and concisely defined including the infamous triple state checkboxes.  0 = unchecked, Â½ = half checked, 1 = fully checked.
- The XWF default state for a check box is defined with a '*' character.
- Important points are called out with a '!' character such as when XWF needs to be running as Admin or when a checkbox will set a registry key on your local system.
