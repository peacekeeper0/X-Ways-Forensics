# X-Ways Forensics Resources

## Tooltips.txt
A replacement Tooltips.txt file for the one included with XWF.  This one has the following notable features.
- The results of checking a box are clearly and consisely defined including the infamous triple state checkboxes.  0 = unchecked, Â½ = half checked, 1 = fully checked.
- The XWF default state for a check box is defined with a '*' character.
- Important points are called out with a '!' character such as when XWF needs to be running as Admin or when a check box will set a registry key on your local system.
